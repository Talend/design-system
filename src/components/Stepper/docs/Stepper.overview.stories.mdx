# Overview

It helps users avoid frustration and successfully complete a primary task.

The stepper displays progress through a sequence splitted into multiple logical and numbered steps.

A Stepper is **vertical by default** but can be horizontal.

**Vertical**

Consider to use a vertical stepper when there are workflows greater than 3 steps.

**Horizontal**

Consider to use an horizontal stepper when full page components are used (such as Data grid or List) 

An horizontal stepper cannot have more than 3 steps. 

The sub-steps option is not available with the horizontal stepper.
